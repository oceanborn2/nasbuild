== Introduction

This repository shelters notes on my current NAS build based on CWWK motherboad.

==  Hardware

=== Case

The case is a https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-804/black[Fractal design Node 804]

It features:

* lot of rooms for up to 2 2.5 inches HDD/SDDs + 8 3.5 inches HDD/SDDs. 

* A dedicated slot for slim optical disk with an opening for the disk ejection.

* USB 3.0 connectors on the front panel (to connect to the 3.x connector on the motherboard). Does not support 3.1 or 3.2 gen2.

* Power buttons

* Disks leds

* Audio jack

=== Cooling options

Essentially all Intel LGA1700 compatible sockets footnote:[despite the motherboard and CPU being AMD ]




==== TPM module

The JTPM1 header provide a TPM interface although after an initial boot in the BIOS, I discovered that there is a TPM already provided by AMD (chipset?) that works fine. Thus it does not seem necessary to buy one such module.


Beware of the pins layouts, the connector has 14 pins but at least two different & incompatible layout exists:



=== Hard drives



=== Extensions through PCI-E x16 (x8 limited) slot

The motherboard seems to be PCI-E bifurcation capable but however it is not sure whether this can be up in the BIOS.

This would be useful to reuse the x16 slot (only x8 signals) as a splitter to accomodate other boards in x4 or x1 such as:

* network cards (x4 directly)

* nvme ssds  (2 x4 lanes on nvme M2 adapter) 

* wifi/BT cards hooked to an nvme M2 adapter.
