== Introduction

This repository shelters notes on my current NAS build based on CWWK motherboad.

==  Hardware

=== Case

The case is a https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/node/node-804/black[Fractal design Node 804]

It features:

* support for either micro atx-or mini-itx form factors motherboards.

* lots of room for up to two 2.5 inches HDD/SDDs + eight 3.5 inches HDD/SDDs.

* A dedicated slot for slim optical disk with an opening for the disk ejection.

* USB 3.0 connectors on the front panel (to connect to the 3.x connector on the motherboard). Does not support 3.1 or 3.2 gen2.

* Power button (no reset button & chord available?)

* Disks activity led

* Audio jacks (headset/speaker, mic). See <<AUDIO>>

* A front panel for power button, leds, ...


=== Motherboard

The motherboard is made by http://www.toptonminipc.com[Topton] which also seems related to https://www.changwang.com/contactus.html[Changwang / CWWK].

|====================


[[AUDIO]]

==== Audio connector to the front panel

 There does not seem to be any hda audio connector on the motherboard. This disallows connection to the front-panle audio jacks.

 However, there is an audio jack on the IO back-panel.

==== BIOS information

American Megratrends International BIOS https://www.ami.com/aptio[Aptio] version FMA01P5C9V06. On Nascompares video, it shows as FMA01P5C9V10 (update available?).

=== Power unit

I chose to use https://www.corsair.com/fr/fr/p/psu/cp-9020200-eu/rmx-series-rm850x-850-watt-80-plus-gold-fully-modular-atx-psu-eu-cp-9020200-eu[Corsair RM850x 850W] footnote:[A bit oversized but offers Gold level conversion and I anticipate to use it to power other independant devices in the case if at all possible?]

=== Cooling options

* https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/HP400SWhite.html[Jonsbo HP400S white] footnote:[available as an option when buying]

Essentially all Intel LGA1700 compatible sockets footnote:[despite the motherboard and CPU being AMD ]




==== TPM module

The JTPM1 header provide a TPM interface although after an initial boot in the BIOS, I discovered that there is a TPM already provided by AMD (chipset?) that works fine. Thus it does not seem necessary to buy one such module.


Beware of the pins layouts, the connector has 14 pins but at least two different & incompatible layout exists:

* https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0BRCQL7WY?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details[incorrect pinout despite being label as JTPM 2.0]

=== Hard drives

[options="header",cols="4,6,1,1"]
|====================

| Feature   | Component | Quantity | Powered by default?

| Main data store | 4TB Western digital SSD   | 1 | Yes

| Proxmox boot and VM store | 2TB Western digital SSD   | 1 | Yes

| Backups (main store, archives) | Western digital 8TB Red NAS disk drive | 2 | No

| Secondary backups / temporary store | Western digital 3TB green disk drive | 2 | No

| Manual power on/off switches |Power PCI sister boards| 2 |

|====================

INFO:: All HDDs are connected to power through a PCI card with individual switches thus allowing to power off those devices when not in use. Each board can power 4 drives and has a dedicated power cable to the PSU.



=== Extensions through PCI-E x16 (x8 limited) slot

The motherboard seems to be PCI-E bifurcation footnote:[https://www.startech.com/en-us/blog/what-is-pcie-bifurcation] capable but however it is not sure whether this can be up in the BIOS.

This would be useful to reuse the x16 slot (only x8 signals) as a splitter to accomodate other boards in x4, x2, x1 such as:

* network cards (x4 attached directly to pcie bus)

** wifi/BT cards hooked to an nvme M2 adapter with A or E key.

* nvme ssds  (2 x4 lanes on nvme M2 adapter) with B or M key.

=== Using molex connectors to power other devices

Is it possible to power other devices such as a Rasperry PI or other ARM boards without needing to use another power to save to costs on electricity conversions.

The Corsair RM850x is largely sufficient but this probably requires a small board to turn into micro usb or usb c or DC IN depending on the boards power inputs.
